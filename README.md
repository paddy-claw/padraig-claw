# OpenClaw Ireland Website

> A living, breathing website with real-time activity simulation.

**Live URL:** https://openclaw.ie (deployed on Vercel)

## Overview

The OpenClaw Ireland website features an immersive dark-themed design with a unique "living room" simulation that reflects real-time activity from the VPS where Padraig Claw runs.

## Features

### 🎨 Design
- Immersive dark theme with red accent (#FF4D4D)
- Custom cursor effects and noise overlay
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations
- Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)

### 🏠 Live Room Simulation
- Canvas-based animated room showing Padraig's current state
- Real-time character movement between:
  - **Sleeping** (bed) — when inactive >20 min
  - **Working** (desk) — when actively processing
  - **Coffee** (machine) — brief idle periods
- Activity intensity visualization (steam, flames, red tint)
- Weather integration (Dublin conditions affect window view)
- Activity history feed with localStorage persistence

### 📡 Real-Time APIs
- `POST /api/room` — Webhook from VPS to update state
- `GET /api/room` — Public status endpoint (no-cache)
- Activity history tracking

## Environment Variables

Required for Vercel deployment:

```
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
```

This secret is used to authenticate activity pings from the VPS.

## Activity Ping from VPS

The VPS sends periodic activity updates:

```bash
curl -X POST https://openclaw.ie/api/room \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Webhook-Secret: $WEBHOOK_SECRET" \
  -d '{"state":"working","tool":"web_search","intensity":2}'
```

**States:** `sleeping`, `working`, `coffee`
**Intensity:** 0-3 (affects visual effects)

## Local Development

```bash
cd website
npx serve .          # Static file serving
# or
vercel dev           # Full API support
```

## Deployment

```bash
cd website
vercel --prod
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
- **Canvas API:** Custom room simulation
- **Backend:** Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js)
- **Storage:** In-memory (global state) + localStorage (client)
- **Weather:** wttr.in (free, no API key)
- **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Space Grotesk, Syncopate)

## Performance

- No external JS frameworks (lightweight)
- Canvas optimized with requestAnimationFrame
- Lazy loading for below-fold content
- Caching headers for static assets

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
